    <string name="jscore_explanation">The J-Score represents the percentile battery life you see relative
        to all other devices being measured by Carat. So, if you have a J-Score of 50, that means
        your expected battery life is better than half of our users; a score of 99 means you have
        better battery life than 99 of our users.
        Of course, a single number does not provide a complete description of your battery life.
        A low J-Score could mean that your device is using a big battery inefficiently or a small
        battery with average efficiency. Similarly, a high J-Score could simply mean that you don\'t
        use your device heavily. Carat computes a huge variety of statistics, and the J-Score is
        just one of them.
    </string>
    <string name="memory_explanation">
        The operating system (OS) classifies your device\'s physical memory as either used or free.
        If memory is used, it means there is currently data there that belongs to some process
        (like one of your apps or the OS, itself). When the device runs
        out of free memory, it needs
        to make room so it can store new data, which means closing apps that might be running in the
        background or asking your apps to throw away data they aren\'t using.
        The OS then further subcategorizes used memory as being either active or inactive,
        depending on whether it was accessed recently or not, respectively. When the OS runs out of
        free memory, it starts reclaiming inactive memory.
        When you open a bunch of apps, the fraction of used memory may increase; when the apps you
        have running are working with lots of data (often an energy-intensive task), the fraction
        of active memory may increase. The OS also preloads often used applications into memory,
        shortening wait times.
    </string>
    <string name="cpu_usage_explanation">CPU Usage shows a percentage of how much of your device\'s
        processing power is currently being used. High percentages mean that the device is fully loaded
        in terms of processing power, such as when playing games or installing new applications.</string>
    <string name="well_behaved_explanation">
        Well-behaved apps use an appropriate amount of energy and don\'t usually require user intervention.
    </string>
    <string name="jscore_dialog_title">J-SCORE</string>
    <string name="what_are_these_numbers_title">What are these numbers?</string>
    <string name="what_are_these_numbers_explanation">Expected benefit is the amount of battery life
        that fixing the hog/bug is expected to yield. Fixing hogs means killing the app and using
        it less, while fixing a bug may mean just restarting the app, updating it to the latest version, or changing some of the app\'s settings.
        <b>Samples</b> shows how many measurements we have of this app, across all users. More samples means the app is common and its energy use well known.

        rate that was the average of what Carat observed on your device during active use.
        This average rate excludes times that your device was idle and, as always, cannot account for
        behavior when Carat was not running.
        You may find that this number is much higher or lower than what you expect, but it more closely
        summarizes, statistically speaking, the intensity of your active device use.
